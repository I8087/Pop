# Pop
Pop is a programming language that has the flexibility of C and the readability of Python, while maintaining the power of both languages. Although Pop follows Python and C syntax; I've added a lot of my own specifications, as well. The goal for Pop is to create a Pythonic language that allows for low-level functions, while creating a high-level language.

Currently, pop is only available for Windows XP and up. Linux support coming soon.
