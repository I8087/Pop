# Pop
Pop is a programming language that's a mix between C and Python. I've also added a lot of my own specifications, as well. The goal is to create a Pythonic language that allows for low-level functions, while creating a high-level language.
Currently, pop is only for Windows XP and up. The programs built are 32-bit application, not 64-bit.

# Releases
Prebuilt binaries for win32 can be found [here](https://github.com/I8087/Pop/releases).
